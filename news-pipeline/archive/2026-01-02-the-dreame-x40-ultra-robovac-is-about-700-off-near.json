  "summary": "The Dreame X40 Ultra used to be one of our robot vacuums on the market before its successor took its place.\t\n\nWith the year coming to a close, now’s a good time to set yourself up for a cleaner, more organized start in 2026. The Dreame X40 Ultra — one of our favorite robot vacuum deals from Black Friday — can handle most of the heavy lifting for you, and it’s once again on sale. You can currently buy it for $503 ($697 off) at Amazon at checkout, which is just $4 more than its record low price set during Black Friday.\nDreame X40 Ultra\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1199.99 $503 at Amazon\n $1199.99 $649.99 at Dreame \n $1199.99 $549.99 at Best Buy\n\nBefore the Dreame X50 Ultra took its place, the X40 Ultra was our favorite robovac / mop hybrid for hard floors and carpets. Like the X50 Ultra, it delivers excellent mopping performance, thanks to dual oscillating mop pads that can extend into edges and reach under consoles and cabinets. It can also automatically detach and reattach its mop pads when switching between mopping and vacuuming.\nWhile the X50 Ultra is nearly twice as powerful, the X40 Ultra’s 12,000Pa of suction is still more than capable of handling everyday dirt and debris. It also features AI-powered dirt detection, allowing the robot to slow down and make additional passes over especially dirty areas. What’s more, the X40 Ultra can empty its own dustbin, refill its water tank, and clean its washboard, with mop pads that wash and dry themselves for minimal upkeep.\nWhat you don’t get are some of the newer X50 Ultra upgrades, including the motorized swing arm that lets it clear higher thresholds and the improved dual rubber roller brush system, which does a better job picking up fine debris. That said, the X40 Ultra still performed very well in our testing, making it a great investment — especially considering it now costs about half as much as its successor.\nSome more deals to wrap up the year\nYou can buy the Baseus 163W Retractable Car Charger for $28.49 ($21 off) at Amazon, which is its best price to date.  The charger can power up to four devices at once, thanks to three USB-C ports and a single USB-A port that together deliver up to 163 watts of total output. That’s enough to charge everything from phones and earbuds to tablets and even laptops. It also includes two built-in retractable USB-C cables, so that’s one less thing you need to worry about bringing while on the go.\nApple’s Crossbody Strap has dropped to a record-low price, starting at $41.99 ($17 off) at Amazon. The strap attaches to compatible iPhone cases — including the iPhone Air with a Bumper case and Apple’s Silicone and TechWoven cases for the iPhone 17 lineup — letting you carry your phone hands-free. The length is adjustable, and it comes in a range of colors, several of which are pricier but also at record-low prices.\nThe last-generation Polaroid Now Plus is on sale for $89.99 ($60 off) at Best Buy in white, which is the cheapest it’s ever been. If you’re after an instant camera with a retro, old-school feel, the second-gen Now Plus is still a solid option, offering Bluetooth support, a range of creative shooting modes through its companion app, and multiple physical lenses. While its photos aren’t as sharp as newer models — including our favorite, the Polaroid Flip — the older Now Plus remains a worthwhile option at this price.",
