  "aiReason": "The article is highly niche, focusing on a retro web design element, which does not directly align with Lman's core expertise in AI, Web3, startups, or privacy tech. However, it offers a marginal opportunity to provide critical commentary by contrasting this type of nostalgic tech with the strategic importance and business value of high-impact areas like AI and Web3.",
  "suggestedAngle": "Use the article as a springboard to emphasize the importance of focusing on high-impact, business-critical technologies like AI/Web3, contrasting them with niche, nostalgic tech projects that lack significant business value.",
  "draftTweet": "A nostalgic web button. Interesting craft, but let's be clear: the future of value creation isn't in retro pixels. It's in AI infrastructure, Web3 utility, and solving real business problems. Focus matters.",
