  "aiReason": "This article discusses a niche HTML syntax detail from 2017, which is far outside Lman's core expertise in AI/LLM, Web3, startup ecosystem, or privacy tech. It offers negligible business value insight and has very low relevance or engagement potential for Lman's target audience of tech entrepreneurs.",
  "suggestedAngle": "Critique the tendency for developers or founders to focus on technical minutiae over strategic product development and business value, highlighting the opportunity cost of such discussions.",
  "draftTweet": "Optional HTML tags: a relic from 2017. While interesting for spec nerds, founders' time is better spent building value and solving real problems, not debating syntax minutiae. Focus on what truly moves the needle.",
