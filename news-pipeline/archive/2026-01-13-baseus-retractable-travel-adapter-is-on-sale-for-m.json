  "summary": "If you’re planning on traveling at all this year, the Baseus EnerCore CG11 Universal Travel Adapter is worth a look. The adapter can power up to six devices at once, and now through the end of today, January 12th,  it’s on sale for just $34.19 (about $36 off) at Amazon, matching the all-time low price we last saw at the end of November.\nBaseus EnerCore CG11 Universal Travel Adapter\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $69.99 $34.19 at Amazon\n $69.99 $39.99 at Baseus\n\nBaseus’ handy wall adapter supports four different plug types so you can use it in more than 200 countries, including the US, UK, much of Europe, Australia, India, and South Africa. Instead of requiring you to pack a separate cable, it also includes a built-in USB-C cable that extends up to 27 inches. The braided cord can deliver up to 70W of power and retracts into the adapter, too, making it easy to carry.\nIn addition to the aforementioned built-in cable, the EnerCore CG11 features three USB ports on the bottom: one USB-C port that delivers up to 60W, a USB-A port that delivers up to 60W, and a USB-A port that delivers up to 5W.  That means you can charge your phone, tablet, camera, tablet, earbuds, and even a laptop — albeit slowly — without having to carry multiple chargers with you while you travel.\nDespite its versatility, the adapter weighs about half a pound and can fit in the palm of your hand, so it won’t add a ton of unnecessary bulk to your backpack or luggage. You can even take it on a cruise, as it doesn’t include surge protection, a feature that’s often banned on cruise ships.",

  "suggestedAngle": "No suitable angle exists for Lman to provide unique commentary. Posting this would dilute his brand and audience expectations, as it's a retail deal, not a tech industry insight.",
  "draftTweet": "A travel adapter deal? While practical, my focus remains on AI's transformative power, Web3's complex landscape, and the startup ecosystem's future. This isn't the tech discussion we need to have.",
