To me, it’s freeing. Sure, it can take away from the slick design. But using a case relieves me of the worry that the console will accumulate tons of little scratches, or worse. I’ve tested several types of cases on the Nintendo Switch 2 since it launched in June, including flimsy shells that snap or slide onto the Switch 2 to provide a simple, aesthetically pleasing barrier from scratches to the console and its Joy-Cons. I’ve also tested carrying cases that protect the console when it isn’t in use.\nIt didn’t take long for me to find one that I think is the best, but that hasn’t stopped me from trying new options from brands that are familiar, as well as from companies that aren’t household names. There’s something for everyone — and every budget — below.\nI just listed my high standards for form-fitting cases made to fit the Switch 2 while it’s in use. However, the bar for carrying cases is lower. They just need to protect the console and, ideally, provide some extra value, like a pocket for cables, cartridge storage, or ideally both.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for my favorite case, I didn’t want to make any major compromises; I wanted one that’s just as good for handheld mode as when docked, which is why I think the Dbrand Killswitch is the best model overall. I published a full review of the Killswitch, but the skinny is that while it’s perhaps more expensive than some may hope to pay, the level of protection and versatility it offers is worth the cost.\nThe best Switch 2 case for both handheld and docked play\nDbrand Killswitch – Switch 2\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nVery secure fit\nMakes the Switch 2 feel more like a Steam Deck (in the best ways)\nClever dock adapter\n\nChunky dock adapter\nNot the most affordable case\nFront protection only comes in the $80 tier\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $59.95 at Dbrand\n $134.8 $99.8 at Dbrand (Ultra kit)\n $79.99 at Best Buy (Travel kit)\n\nThe least expensive Killswitch tier costs $59.95 and includes a set of Joy-Con 2 grips, a rear cover for the console and a small matching piece to adhere to its kickstand, all of which securely latch onto each component. It also includes one of Dbrand’s skins. There’s no piece of the Killswitch that feels like it’ll incidentally wiggle off. \nUnfortunately, the protective case makes it impossible to fit the Switch 2 into the dock. However, Dbrand includes its workaround adapter that fits into the dock, essentially acting as an extender for it’s USB-C jack. It’s a fairly elegant solution that works as intended. The only downside is that it leaves your Switch 2’s screen exposed instead of concealed by the dock’s plastic wall. It’s a little clunky, but I’m willing to forgive it because it allows the Switch 2 to retain its docking functionality.\nThe tier I recommend for most Switch 2 players (especially those who will often throw their console into a bag) is the $79.85 “Travel” tier, which includes a semi-transparent cover that protects the front of your console when you aren’t using it. The cover fits around the front of your Killswitch-equipped console, securing around the back with a tough bungee cord latch. This tier also includes a pair of analog stick grips and a tray that holds 10 Switch cartridges and fits neatly within the travel cover.\nWhen this guide was first published, Dbrand was in the midst of updating its Killswitch so that it wouldn’t allow the Joy-Con 2s’ magnets to break away without you pressing their magnet-releasing buttons. In other words, if you held your Killswitch-equipped Switch 2 parallel to the ground solely by either of the Joy-Con 2 controllers and give it a shake, the entire console portion was likely to detach, potentially causing serious damage to the console. Dbrand redesigned the Joy-Con 2 grips to fix the issue, and previous buyers can request a replacement free of charge. Future buyers will receive the Killswitch with the updated, improved grips. We’ve received the tweaked pieces and can confirm that they fix the issue.\nRead my full review of the Dbrand Killswitch case for the Nintendo Switch 2\nRunner-up\nJSAUX Split Protective Case\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29.99 $26.99 at Amazon\n $29.99 $26.99 at Jsaux (with promo code PC0114)\n\nThe Jsaux Split Protective Case is an affordable alternative to Dbrand’s Killswitch, costing $29.99 but with many of the same characteristics. It includes two Joy-Con 2 grips that let you detach them from the system at will, and a transparent shell to clip around the back and the top and bottom edges of the Switch 2. Unlike the Killswitch, however, the Jsaux shell is so thin that the console can still fit into the dock. It also comes with a hard front cover that protect the screen during transit (or just for safekeeping), and it has storage for 10 Switch cartridges on its underside.\nI’ve got minor qualms with Jsaux’s case, which I can overlook given its low price (and may not be an issue for you, anyway); the Joy-Con 2 grips are smaller, and don’t add as much bulk or grip as Dbrand’s Killswitch, but they’re still serviceable. Also, its build quality isn’t as good (for instance, on my review unit, there was a little bit of warped plastic that looks like a raised eyebrow near the power and volume buttons, though it’s hard to say if this affects multiple units). \nLastly, the design of its Joy-Con 2 grips exhibit the same edge case issue that Dbrand’s model initially faced before it issued a free fix to all owners. If you hold the Switch 2 by either Joy-Con and shake the console’s full weight downward, the force may be enough to completely detach it, sending the console down to the ground. In my testing, it was really difficult to get the Switch 2 to fall, so this hopefully shouldn’t impact many people, but it’s worth mentioning nevertheless.\nJsaux ModCase Ultimate\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $60 at Jsaux\n\nAnother runner-up is the ModCase from Jsaux. The foundation of the accessory pack is the plastic and silicone case that the console fits into (you can’t remove the Joy-Con or use the kickstand once it’s inside), which adds bulkier grips that make it more comfortable to hold. There’s a small section on the rear of the case that juts out, and that’s where each of its “mods” can be attached.\nThe basic $29.99 kit includes just a couple of basics: a kickstand (which works better on tables than laps) and a watch-like strap for holding a power bank during charging. The $59.99 Ultimate kit that Jsaux sent for testing includes those plus several other extras. You get a face plate for the console to protect its screen while not in use, as well as an accessory with a magnet to let you attach, say, your iPhone so you can view it while you play games. Lastly, it includes a USB-C dock extender with a silicone stand. It’s like a dock for your dock, for use when the ModCase is installed. It looks more cumbersome than Dbrand’s also-clumsy-looking solution included with the Killswitch. But, hey, it all works as intended performance-wise.\nThe best carrying cases for the Switch 2\nTomtoc FancyCase-G05 Nintendo Switch 2 Slim Case\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $36.99 $24.99 at Amazon\n $36.99 at Tomtoc\n\nTomtoc’s FancyCase Slim case has recently become my favorite Switch 2 zip-up case. Starting at around $33 and going up to $39 depending on the style that suits you best, it’s not the most affordable option. But it’s worth the cost if you want better protection than either the PowerA or Belkin cases below can provide. It has less give in its middle section by comparison. Another thing that sets it apart are the bulbous sections on the outer cover, which offer more vertical clearance above the Joy-Con 2’s analog sticks, ensuring they don’t get pressed while your console’s inside. Oh, and it includes color options that look like ice cream sandwiches.\nThe FancyCase Slim case is the best option I’ve tried not just for durability but also for a dash of style. That said, it’s short on other perks to justify the price. While Belkin’s Switch 2 carrying case features a pocket for storing microSD Express cards, a cable, or any other small trinket like an AirTag to track its location, the only thing inside of this one is a soft screen-protecting flap that can hold 12 Switch cartridges on the other side.\nRunners-up\nWaterField Designs CitySlicker case for Switch 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129 at WaterField Designs\n\nWaterField Designs has been making tweaks to its beloved, but pricey CitySlicker case for every major handheld to come along. For fans of the case, or those who are looking for a more premium option, the $129 Switch 2 version doesn’t change what isn’t broken. The City Slicker hugs the console’s curves closely enough to ensure a snug fit with a fleece interior, flanked by two pockets for cables and small accessories — one in front of where the Switch 2 sits, and one behind it. There’s a larger zip-up mesh pocket on its back.\nHigh-quality materials set this case apart from the others on this list, and unsurprisingly are what drives up the cost. It features leather on the flap covering the system and around the front of the case. For the secondary material, you have the option of waxed canvas or ballistic nylon. If you want your Switch 2 to sleep in style, this would make for a great gift to yourself or to another game. However, the City Slicker likely won’t protect your console as much as a tougher zip-up or cover case can. Not to mention, you may prefer a case with more cartridge slots than the five that are punched out of this case’s luxe leather.\nPowerA Slim Case for Nintendo Switch 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $19.99 $13.3 at Amazon\n $19.99 $13.5 at Best Buy\n $19.99 $13.3 at Walmart\n\nPower A’s slim zip-up case for the Switch 2 is a simple and inexpensive way to keep your console safe when you aren’t using it. It’s not a hard case, so it won’t survive catastrophic damage, but it’s a fine choice if you don’t want to add a bunch of heft. To that end, it’s one of the slimmest cases that I have tried. \nAt just $19.99 (half the cost of Nintendo’s official carrying case), baseline protection alone would be sufficient, but it offers safe storage for up to 10 Switch cartridges, too. The cartridge holder has a soft bottom that protects the screen, and it can also fold into a tent, allowing the Switch 2 to rest against it (the Switch 2 already has a kickstand for this).\nThis case doesn’t suffer from a negative trait that’s common among other slim cases (some of which are pricier than PowerA’s): being able to press on the Joy-Con 2 joysticks from the outside. Other cases might allow your Switch 2 to suffer some joystick damage unbeknownst to you, but not this one, as well as the others included in this section.\nBelkin Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29.99 $24.99 at Amazon\n $29.99 at Belkin\n\nFor $10 more ($29.99), Belkin’s slim case is better-looking than PowerA’s and is made with better materials. It has a carrying strap, a large mesh pocket, and a secret compartment for an Apple AirTag or similar Bluetooth tracker, all of which the PowerA case lacks. Belkin’s case can carry 12 cartridges, and it’s only slightly thicker than the PowerA case, likely to compensate for whatever cables or small gizmos you might stuff into its pocket. It features deep grooves to fit the Joy-Con 2’s triggers, and its outer shell it tough enough to prevent most accidental presses on the joysticks. It comes in dark gray, cream, and a fun green shade.\nBelkin sells a $69.99 version of its slim case that features everything above and includes a 10,000mAh 20W battery for keeping the Switch 2 charged while it’s inside the case. The company says the battery can fully charge the console 1.5 times. The battery results in a thicker case, and its bespoke compartment only holds the specific Belkin model that’s included, so you won’t be able to swap in a different, faster-charging battery. Neither of those may be deal-breakers for you, but are worth keeping in mind.\nThe best grip case for the Switch 2’s handheld mode\nThe Killswitch is the best case for handheld mode because it allows you to remove the Joy-Con 2 controllers and includes an adapter to easily connect to the dock. Plus, it offers kickstand access.\nIf you don’t ever plan to connect your Switch 2 to its dock or detach its Joy-Cons, or it’ll be a rare occurrence, you might pick an all-in-one shell that fits completely around the console. It will protect every angle of your Switch 2 from dings and scratches, and may even keep it safe in the event of a drop.\nThe $29.99 Spigen Rugged Armor is a suitable option. It fits around nearly every nook of the Switch 2, leaving access to its headphone jack, USB-C ports, and speakers (it doesn’t cover up the air vents either because that’d be silly). It gets bonus points for fitting around the edges of the Joy-Con 2 while providing more pronounced grips, which may be a boon for those who experience hand or wrist pain while holding the console in handheld mode. However, as noted, you’ll need to remove the case in order to install the Switch 2 into its dock.\nSpigen Rugged Armor for Nintendo Switch 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $39.99 $17.99 at Amazon\n $39.99 at Spigen\n\nWhat’s coming next?\nBelkin is sending over its new Charging Case Pro for testing. The company debuted this new model at CES 2026, and it features some thoughtful upgrades compared to the $70 charging case that includes a battery. Namely, you don’t have to connect the Switch 2 and the battery together via a cable. Just nestle the Switch 2 into the kickstand-meets-cradle. The case also features a screen that shows battery percentage remaining, and an external USB-C port for easily recharging the case.\nUpdate, January 13th: Verified prices and stock for products mentioned in this post. \nDisclosure: In 2023, The Verge collaborated with Dbrand on a series of skins and cases.",
