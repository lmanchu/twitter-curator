  "summary": "The 15-inch MacBook Air offers better speakers than its 13-inch sibling, but is otherwise similar.\t\n\nApple currently sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series processors in a wide range of sizes and price points, all of which run the company’s newest operating system, macOS 26. Purchasing a new MacBook can be complicated if you’re trying to figure out what specs you need, but finding a deal on a relatively speedy model is surprisingly easy, especially since Apple increased the starting RAM on several models in late 2024.\n\n\nThese days, it’s not uncommon to see various MacBooks discounted by up to $800. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain configurations of older models as Apple continues to move forward with newer releases. Apple’s refurbished store offers a one-year warranty and generally discounts new units by up to 20 percent.\nBut if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.\nThe best MacBook Air deals\nM4 MacBook Air\nIn March, Apple released an updated MacBook Air, which comes in both a 13- and 15-inch configuration with an M4 processor. Interestingly, the latest Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, comes in a fresh sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro. Needless to say, there’s a lot to like.\nBoth the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are currently receiving some sizable discounts, too. You can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, an eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for around $799 ($200 off), which is just $50 shy of its lowest price to date. If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is on sale for about $999 ($200 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which remains its second-best price to date.\n13-inch MacBook Air (M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999 $799.99 at Amazon\n $999 $799 at Best Buy\n $999 $889 at B&H Photo\n\n\n15-inch MacBook Air (M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1199 $999.99 at Amazon\n $1199 $1099 at B&H Photo\n $1199 $999 at Best Buy\n\nThe best MacBook Pro deals\nM4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pro\nIn November 2024, Apple released the M4-series MacBook Pro. Notably, the base 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro is the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is open. Also new in this model is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black.\nThe 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View, as well as the optional nano-texture display option.\nMany variations of the M4 MacBook Pro with different screen and processor configurations are on sale right now. For example, the 14-inch M4 Pro with a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is available for $1,299 ($300 off) at B&H Photo. You can also pick up the 14-inch Pro with 24GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and an M4 Pro chip (12-core CPU / 16-core GPU) at Amazon and Best Buy for $1,749 ($250 off), which is a solid discount even if it’s not the biggest price drop we’ve seen in recent months.\nThe base 16-inch MacBook Pro, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for around $2,249 ($250 off), which is $120 more than the all-time low we saw during Black Friday.\nApple MacBook Pro 14 (2024, M4)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1599 $1299 at B&H Photo (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\n\n14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2499 $1749 at Amazon (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $1999 $1999 at Adorama (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\n\nApple MacBook Pro 16 (2024, M4 Pro)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2499 $2249.99 at Amazon (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $2499 $2249 at Best Buy (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\nM5 MacBook Pro\nApple’s latest revision of the 14.2-inch MacBook Pro adds the M5 processor. The generational leap will be felt most by those who have an older MacBook Pro, not those upgrading from the M4, unless you use specific AI apps that tap into the chip’s new Neural Accelerators. As for other design changes and upgrades to the inside and outside of this MacBook Pro, there really aren’t any major ones to note; in fact, it’s so similar to the M4 model that our reviewer Antonio Di Benedetto had to write “M5” on a sticky note just to be able to tell them apart. That being said, it’s still an amazing laptop, one that’s just now starting to get minor discounts.\nThe 14.2-inch base model with the M5 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is down to $1,449 ($150 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo, which is $100 shy of its best price to date.\nMacBook Pro 14-inch (M5, 2025)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1599 $1449 at Amazon (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $1599 $1449 at Best Buy (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $1599 $1449 at B&H Photo (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\nThe best Mac Mini deals\nThe newest Mac Minis in town are the M4-based models, which arrived in late 2024. Apple reduced the horizontal footprint of its desktop and paired it with its M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, which is double that of the previous generation and brings it in line with other base model Macs from 2024. That makes Apple’s newest desktop computer a tremendous value.\nM4 and M4 Pro Mac Mini\nDeals on the newest Mac Mini are a bit easier to come by now than they were at launch, which is good since the outgoing M2 model is becoming more difficult to find. The M4 Mac Mini starts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival the Mac Studio and Mac Pro when it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. Vertically, the M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the last-gen M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep.\nIn addition to the odd decision to place the power button on its underside, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three Thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for another $100.\nIn the past, we’ve seen the base Mac Mini drop to as low as $469, but right now it’s only on sale at Amazon and B&H Photo with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $499 ($100 off). If you need more storage, you can step up to the version with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $689 ($110 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo. Meanwhile, the base M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is on sale for $1,269 ($130 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo.\nApple Mac Mini (M4)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $599 $499 at B&H Photo (16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\n $599 $499 at Amazon (16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\n $799 $689 at Amazon (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\nUpdate, January 16th: Updated to reflect current pricing and availability.",
