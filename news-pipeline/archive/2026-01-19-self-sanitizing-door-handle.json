  "aiReason": "The article details a 2019 James Dyson Award project, making the core content significantly outdated. While it recently surfaced on Hacker News, its low points (9) and comments (10) indicate minimal current community interest. The topic of a 'self-sanitizing door handle' is a hardware design innovation, which falls outside Lman's core expertise in AI/LLM, Web3, startup ecosystems (focused on software/AI), and privacy tech. This limits the potential for Lman to provide unique, expert commentary and for his audience to engage meaningfully with the post.",
  "suggestedAngle": "No strong angle is recommended due to the low relevance and timeliness. Any commentary would be a general critique on the challenges of bringing hardware innovations to market or the longevity of design concepts, rather than leveraging Lman's specialized tech insights.",
  "draftTweet": "A 2019 Dyson award project for a self-sanitizing door handle resurfaces on HN. While design ingenuity is always interesting, the real value is in scalable, impactful tech. This isn't where the current innovation battles are being fought.",
