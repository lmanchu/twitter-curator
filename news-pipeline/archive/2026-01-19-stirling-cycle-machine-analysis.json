  "aiReason": "The article on Stirling Cycle Machine Analysis is entirely outside Lman's core expertise (AI/LLM, Web3, startups, privacy tech). It offers no clear avenue for unique commentary, connection to business value, or engagement with his audience, making it irrelevant to his content strategy.",
  "suggestedAngle": "Not recommended for Lman's content. The topic is too far removed from his areas of expertise to provide authentic, valuable commentary or spark relevant discussion within his established audience.",
  "draftTweet": "Stirling Cycle Machines: fascinating engineering, but completely outside my domain. No direct relevance to AI, Web3, or startup strategy. Not for my feed. Focus remains on what truly moves the needle in tech.",
