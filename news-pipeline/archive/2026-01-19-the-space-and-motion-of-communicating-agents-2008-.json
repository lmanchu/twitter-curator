  "aiReason": "A 2008 academic paper on theoretical computer science. While 'communicating agents' touches on Lman's AI expertise, its age and abstract nature make it low on timeliness and direct relevance to current market trends or startup ecosystems. The lack of engagement on HN (0 comments) confirms its limited immediate appeal for social media. Requires significant effort to frame for modern business value.",
  "suggestedAngle": "Critique the gap between foundational theoretical computer science (like bigraphs/agent models) from the past and their practical application or lack thereof in modern AI agent architectures and decentralized systems. Question how much abstract theory truly translates into tangible business value or robust real-world systems today.",
  "draftTweet": "HN surfaces a 2008 paper on 'Communicating Agents'. Fascinating theory, but for modern AI/Web3, the question remains: How do these abstract models translate into *actual* business value or robust systems today? Often, the gap is immense. Critical re-evaluation needed.",
