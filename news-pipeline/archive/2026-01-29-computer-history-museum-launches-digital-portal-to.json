  "aiReason": "While culturally interesting, this is primarily a museum/archive story with limited direct relevance to Lman's core expertise in AI/LLM, Web3, startups, and privacy tech. No clear business or technology angle that would resonate with his audience. Generic digital archival project lacks the innovation or critical tech angle Lman typically covers.",
  "suggestedAngle": "If covering: Focus on how AI/LLMs could enhance digital archives and historical research - but the article doesn't explore this. Better to skip unless there's a unique tech infrastructure or AI application angle.",
  "draftTweet": "Digital archives are nice, but most museums still don't understand how to leverage AI for discovery. CHM's portal is a start—curious if they're using LLMs for semantic search or just basic indexing.",
