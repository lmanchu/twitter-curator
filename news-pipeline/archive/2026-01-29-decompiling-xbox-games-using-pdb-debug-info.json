  "aiReason": "Low relevance to Lman's core expertise areas. While technically interesting, reverse engineering game binaries doesn't connect to AI/LLM, Web3, startup ecosystem, or privacy tech. Generic security/hacking content that doesn't align with stated content preferences.",
  "suggestedAngle": "Not recommended. Could pivot if framed around IP protection failures in gaming industry or security implications for blockchain games, but current angle is too niche.",
  "draftTweet": "Xbox debug symbols left in production binaries = lazy security. This is why game studios need better DevOps practices, not just better engineers.",
