  "aiReason": "While technically interesting, this is ESA infrastructure news with limited relevance to Lman's core expertise (AI/LLM, Web3, Privacy tech, Startups). The satellite story lacks business/startup angle and doesn't connect to his entrepreneurial focus. Generic space tech coverage without unique commentary opportunity.",
  "suggestedAngle": "If covering: Focus on commercial applications - how weather data monetization could create startup opportunities, or compare EU's public infrastructure approach vs. private space companies like SpaceX/Planet Labs",
  "draftTweet": "Europe's building sovereign infrastructure while startups commoditize the same data cheaper. Public sector moving slow, but owning the stack has advantages. Question: who wins the weather data economy?",
