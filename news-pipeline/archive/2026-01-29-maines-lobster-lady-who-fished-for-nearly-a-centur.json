  "aiReason": "This content is entirely irrelevant to Lman's expertise (AI/LLM, Web3/Blockchain, Startup ecosystem, Privacy tech) and target audience. It is a human interest story with zero connection to technology, business value, or the Asian tech scene. Timeliness is irrelevant given the lack of subject matter fit. There is no potential for unique commentary or engagement within Lman's domain.",
  "suggestedAngle": "No relevant angle exists. This content offers no opportunity for Lman to add unique tech or business commentary.",
  "draftTweet": "Hard pass. A lobster fisher's obituary has no place in a tech/startup feed. My audience comes for insights on AI, Web3, and business value, not sentimental filler. Stay focused on what matters.",
