  "aiReason": "This article is a highly technical deep-dive into .NET garbage collector implementation. While technically 'infrastructure,' its low-level focus lacks direct relevance to Lman's core expertise (AI/LLM, Web3, Privacy, Startup ecosystem) and Lman's critical approach to connecting tech with business value. It offers minimal potential for unique, high-level commentary relevant to Lman's audience, which is more interested in strategic tech trends and their business implications.",
  "suggestedAngle": "Critique the focus on intricate implementation details over strategic business value or the broader implications of managed runtimes for modern high-performance systems, especially within the startup context. Emphasize the importance of connecting low-level tech discussions to business outcomes.",
  "draftTweet": "Writing a .NET GC is a deep dive into engineering complexity. But for startups, the real conversation isn't *how* to build a GC, it's about the strategic trade-offs of managed runtimes for performance, cost, and developer velocity. Don't get lost in the weeds.",
