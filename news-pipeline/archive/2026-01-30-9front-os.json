  "aiReason": "9front OS is a niche infrastructure project with limited business relevance. While it touches on systems design, it lacks direct connection to Lman's core expertise (AI/LLM, Web3, startup ecosystem). The HN discussion (30 pts, 18 comments) suggests academic interest but not mainstream tech momentum. Generic infrastructure content without startup/commercialization angle.",
  "suggestedAngle": "If covering: focus on whether alternative OS projects like 9front represent viable infrastructure for privacy-first AI/Web3 applications in Asia, rather than pure technical nostalgia",
  "draftTweet": "9front OS gets HN attention but building alternative OS won't move the needle. Real infrastructure gaps are in privacy-preserving inference layers and decentralized compute—not reinventing Plan 9.",
