  "aiReason": "This is a job posting, not editorial content. While Reflex (YC W23) is relevant to startup ecosystem, a single job listing lacks news value, commentary potential, and engagement hooks. No unique angle or business insight to extract. Better suited for job boards than tech curation.",
  "suggestedAngle": "Not recommended for curation. If covering Reflex, focus on company milestones, funding rounds, or product launches instead.",
  "draftTweet": "Job postings aren't news. Curate company milestones, funding, or product launches instead—those signal actual momentum worth discussing.",
