  "aiReason": "While SpaceX's space infrastructure is technically interesting, this is primarily a hardware/aerospace story with limited relevance to Lman's core expertise in AI/LLM, Web3, and startup ecosystems. The space tech angle doesn't connect to business model innovation or emerging tech trends Lman typically covers. Generic infrastructure news without unique startup/business perspective.",
  "suggestedAngle": "If covering: Focus on the DATA/AI angle - how SpaceX monetizes space situational awareness data, competitive positioning against other space surveillance players, or implications for satellite internet business models. Otherwise, skip.",
  "draftTweet": "SpaceX building space surveillance infrastructure. Question: who owns the data? And can this become a profitable business line separate from Starlink, or is it just vertical integration theater?",
