  "summary": "In case you missed it, we recently overhauled our guides to the best budget robot vacuums and the best mopping vacs, both of which feature a slate of new picks from Roborock, Narwal, Dreame, and others. Dyson’s 360 Vis Nav Robot Vacuum didn’t technically make the cut, though it was once one of our top picks for carpets. And now through the rest of today, January 30th, it’s on sale at Woot with a two-year warranty for an all-time low of $279.99 ($720 off).\nDyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999.99 $349.99 at Amazon\n $999.99 $279.99 at Woot\n $999.99 $399.99 at Dyson\n\nIf you have a relatively simple floor plan with lots of high-pile carpet, Dyson’s D-shaped robovac is worth considering. It can traverse obstacles up to 21 millimeters high and offers a whopping 65 air watts of suction — twice that of many robovacs — rendering it one of the most powerful models our resident smart home reviewer, Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, has ever tested. Its massive roller brush is great at getting into corners and reaching the edges of your rooms given its location at the front of the vac, and it’s outfitted with a huge 500ml dustbin that’s easy to remove via an integrated handle.\nThe 360 Vis Nav isn’t without shortcomings, though. For starters, it doesn’t come with an auto-empty dock and only manages about 65 minutes of runtime, which is about half that of most models, including many of the budget bots we’ve tested. It also lacks AI-powered obstacle avoidance, so it won’t be able to discern what it’s avoiding, increasing the risk of it tripping up while navigating your home. The lack of more advanced features could certainly be a dealbreaker for some, but if pure power is what you’re after, Dyson’s last-gen robot vacuum is easily the best option for the price — especially right now.\nRead our hands-on impressions.\nMore deals and discounts of note\nGoogle’s TV Streamer (4K) is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for $79.99 ($20 off), which is about $5 shy of its best price to date. If you don’t already own a smart TV, Google’s speedy Chromecast follow-up is a great way to access all your favorite streaming apps. It supports 4K HDR with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, along with a handy Find My feature for the remote. You also get built-in support for Google Assistant and one of the best interfaces available in a streaming device right now, one that lets you peruse content recs across a myriad of streaming services. Read our review.\nIf you’re looking to “brick” your phone in the best way possible, you can grab a pair of Brick’s NFC-enabled squares directly from Brick for $106.20 (about $12 off). Basically, you use the Brick app to select which apps and websites you want to block, and then, once you tap your phone to the small device, you’ll be restricted from using said apps until you tap the device again. It’s not a perfect solution for cutting back on screen time — you still get a handful of “emergency unbrick” codes to manually override blocked apps, after all — but adding a little physical friction between you and your phone certainly isn’t a bad thing. Read our hands-on impressions.\nYou shall not pass… up Lego’s Balrog set, which is down to $111.76 (about $18 off) at Amazon and Target right now, nearly matching its all-time low. The posable, 1,2010-piece book nook is a nice little homage to Durin’s Bane, aka the fiery beast that attacks Gandalf in The Fellowship of the Ring. It also comes with a minifig of the aforementioned wizard, along with his sword (ahem, Glamdring) and several movie-themed accessories that let you play out the famed showdown on the Bridge of Khazad-dûm.",
