  "aiReason": "While creative and potentially interesting, this is an art/creative project rather than tech/startup content. Low engagement metrics (13 points, 2 comments on HN) suggest niche appeal. Without seeing the actual content, unclear if there's substantive tech or business angle. Generic 'AI in art' lacks the startup ecosystem or technical infrastructure focus Lman covers.",
  "suggestedAngle": "Only relevant if the installation demonstrates novel AI constraints, novel model behavior, or interesting technical limitations worth discussing. Otherwise, it's creative art, not tech commentary.",
  "draftTweet": "Art installations trapping AI models are cool visually. But what's the actual technical constraint or business insight here? Novelty without substance doesn't move the needle.",
