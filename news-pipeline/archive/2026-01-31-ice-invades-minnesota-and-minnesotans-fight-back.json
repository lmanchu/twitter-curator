(Photo by Steven Garcia/The Verge) | Photo by Steven Garcia / The Verge\t\n\nThe Trump administration has flooded Minneapolis and other parts of Minnesota with federal agents as part of its immigration crackdown, Operation Metro Surge — detaining children, intimidating protestors and community organizers, and killing multiple people.\nMinnesotans have responded with mass community-level resistance, including mutual aid and tracking ICE operations, despite threats and surveillance — including through systems built by tech companies like Clearview AI and Palantir. Backlash to the crackdown spread online after the January 24th killing of Alex Pretti, including among hobbyist communities and typically apolitical influencers.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nDon Lemon has been arrested for covering an anti-ICE protest\n\t\t\t\nParenting in ICE-occupied Minneapolis\n\t\t\t\nI grew up with Alex Pretti\n\t\t\t\nIt doesn’t matter if Alex Pretti had a gun\n\t\t\t\nWhy won’t anyone stop ICE from masking?\n\t\t\t\nThe day of the second killing\n\t\t\t\nHow much can a city take?\n\t\t\t\nMinnesota wants to win a war of attrition\n\t\t\t\nInfluencer content is fuel for an internet-obsessed administration",
