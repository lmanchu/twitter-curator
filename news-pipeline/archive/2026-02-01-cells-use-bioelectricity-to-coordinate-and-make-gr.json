  "aiReason": "While scientifically interesting, this bioelectricity research lacks direct relevance to Lman's core expertise (AI/LLM, Web3, Privacy tech, Startups). It's more biology/fundamental science than tech/business. No clear startup or business angle. Already saturated with science posts on HN.",
  "suggestedAngle": "If covering: Frame around biocomputing/biological computing as future infrastructure - how nature's distributed decision-making could inspire decentralized systems or AI architectures. But this requires significant interpretation beyond the article.",
  "draftTweet": "Cells making group decisions via bioelectricity. Interesting for biocomputing, but the real question: can we replicate this coordination model in decentralized AI systems? Nature's already solved distributed consensus.",
