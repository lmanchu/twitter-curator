  "aiReason": "This content, while generally interesting, sits outside Lman's core expertise (AI/LLM, Web3, Startup ecosystem, Privacy). It offers a marginal opportunity to discuss the intersection of art and engineering design, but connecting it to business value or current startup trends is a stretch.",
  "suggestedAngle": "Discuss the beauty and complexity of fundamental scientific infrastructure, drawing parallels between historical methods of visualizing complex machines (like Da Vinci's) and modern challenges in designing and documenting intricate AI or Web3 architectures. Emphasize the importance of clear design and human understanding in tech, regardless of its scale or domain.",
  "draftTweet": "CERN's CMS detector, reimagined in Da Vinci's style. A testament to engineering as art. It begs the question: How do we bring this level of clarity and aesthetic to visualizing today's AI/Web3 complexity? Are we over-engineering without elegance?",
