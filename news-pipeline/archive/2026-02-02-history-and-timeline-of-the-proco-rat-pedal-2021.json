  "aiReason": "This content, detailing the history of a guitar pedal, falls entirely outside Lman's established expertise in AI, Web3, startups, and privacy tech. It presents no opportunity for unique commentary or connection to business value, and the core article is from 2021, making it untimely for a tech audience.",
  "suggestedAngle": "No relevant angle for Lman's expertise. This content is a complete mismatch.",
  "draftTweet": "A guitar pedal's history offers zero insight into AI, Web3, or startup strategy. We filter for impact and innovation, not analog nostalgia. Focus on what truly moves the needle.",
