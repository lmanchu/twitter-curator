  "aiReason": "While the title is clickbait-worthy, this appears to be a technical complaint about iPhone calculator functionality rather than substantive tech/startup commentary. Limited relevance to Lman's core expertise (AI/LLM, Web3, startup ecosystem). The engagement is driven by novelty/humor rather than business insight. Too similar to generic 'tech product complaint' posts that don't advance meaningful discussion.",
  "suggestedAngle": "If pursuing: Frame as commentary on QA/testing failures at trillion-dollar companies, or how consumer-facing AI/computation bugs erode trust in premium products",
  "draftTweet": "A $1000 device can't do basic math. This isn't a bug report—it's a signal that even Apple's quality gates are breaking under complexity. What does this say about shipping AI features at scale?",
