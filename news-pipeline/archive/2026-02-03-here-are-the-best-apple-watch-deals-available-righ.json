Each wearable offers something a little different (their prices indicate their breadth of features), and we’re already starting to see big price drops. Additionally, we’re still recommending some recent predecessors in Apple’s portfolio, including the Series 10 and Ultra 2, for which discounts are fairly common.\n\n\nBut with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, watchOS 26, launched in September on the Series 6 and newer models. That means those still using a Series 5 or older — including the original Apple Watch SE — are getting left behind in terms of features. \nApple Watch Series 11 deals\nApple Watch Series 11 (42mm, GPS)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $399 $299 at Amazon\n $399 $299 at Walmart\n $399 $299 at Best Buy\n\n\nApple Watch Series 11 (46mm, GPS)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $429 $329 at Amazon\n $429 $329 at Walmart\n $429 $329 at Best Buy\n\nThe new Apple Watch Series 11 is a fairly iterative update of the Series 10, meaning those who already own Apple’s last-gen flagship may not necessarily feel compelled to upgrade. That being said, the newest model does tout a more power-efficient 5G modem and a more scratch-resistant display, as well as an additional 6 hours of battery life over the Series 10. It’s also the slimmest Apple Watch to date and the first to offer FDA-cleared hypertension notifications out of the gate, which you can also now leverage on both the Series 9 and Ultra 2.\nIf you’re looking to be an early adopter, however, you can pick up the Apple Watch Series 11 in the 42mm / GPS configuration at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy starting at $299 ($100 off), which remains the lowest price we’ve seen for the base model. If you prefer the larger 46mm / GPS model, it’s also on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy, where you can grab it for an all-time low of $329 ($100 off).\nRead our full Apple Watch Series 11 review.\nApple Watch Series 10 deals\nApple Watch Series 10 (42mm, GPS)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $399 $249 at Walmart\n\nIf you’re looking for a real deal — and you’re not particularly tempted by what the Series 11 offers — the Series 10 still holds its own. The last-gen smartwatch packs the same S10 SiP chip that’s in the Series 11, as well as support for fast-charging, a gorgeous wide-angle OLED display, and a design that’s still significantly slimmer and lighter than previous models. It also features both depth and water temperature sensors, along with an FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature and the aforementioned hypertension notifications, courtesy of watchOS 26.\nThankfully, the Series 10 remains on sale at Walmart in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $249 ($150 off). The larger 46mm GPS variant is also available at Walmart for an all-time low of $279 ($80 off), though, given the current sale price of the Series 11, we’d recommend purchasing the latter.\nRead our Apple Watch Series 10 review.\nApple Watch SE 3 deals\nApple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 $219 at Amazon\n $249 $219 at Best Buy\n $249 $219 at Walmart\n\n\nApple Watch SE 3 (44mm, GPS)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $279 $249 at Amazon\n $279 $249 at Walmart\n $279 $249 at Best Buy\n\nWhile the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 introduce a handful of iterative updates, the new Apple Watch SE 3 represents a significant upgrade over its 2022 predecessor. The entry-level watch features the same speedy S10 chip found in Apple’s flagship models, for one, letting you take advantage of Apple’s double tap feature, wrist flick gestures, and on-device Siri. The SE 3 also (finally) adds an always-on display, 5G connectivity, support for fast-charging, and audio playback so you can listen to music or podcasts directly from your wrist.\nOn the health front, the SE 3 introduces a wrist-temperature sensor for retrospective ovulation tracking, along with breathing disturbance alerts, sleep apnea notifications, and a new Sleep Score that breaks down time spent in each stage. What you won’t find are the Series 11’s EKG functionality, blood oxygen monitoring, or hypertension notifications — those are exclusive to the Series and Ultra models. \nIn terms of deals, the Apple Watch SE 3 is currently available at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy in its 40mm base configuration with GPS for $219 ($30 off), which is about $20 shy of its lowest price to date. You can also pick up the larger 44mm model at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy starting at $249, a $30 discount.\nRead our full Apple Watch SE 3 review.\nApple Watch SE (second-gen) deals\n2022 Apple Watch SE (44mm, GPS)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $279 $159 at Walmart\n\nIf you don’t need the latest upgrades, the last-gen SE remains a solid buy if you can pick it up at a significant discount. It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which still holds up well, but has fewer sensors (meaning fewer features), no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to Apple’s newer watches. Those omissions might take it out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after.\nRight now, the best deal on the last-gen SE can be found at Walmart, where you can pick up the 44mm model with GPS starting at $159 ($120 off), which remains an all-time low. \nRead our Apple Watch SE (second-gen) review.\nApple Watch Ultra 3 deals\nApple Watch Ultra 3\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799 $773.97 at Amazon (with Ocean Band)\n $799 $773.97 at Amazon (with Alpine Loop)\n $799 $773.97 at Amazon (with Trail Loop)\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 offers the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch available thus far. It features a larger, wide-angle OLED display with a 1Hz refresh rate and thinner bezels, as well as both satellite and 5G connectivity. Better yet, battery life has been extended from 36 hours to 42 hours — a marginal improvement, but one that allows you to squeeze out a bit more life when necessary.\nAs far as deals are concerned, the Ultra 3 recently dropped to an all-time low of $699.99 ($100 off). That said, it’s currently only available at Amazon with either an Ocean Band, a Trail Loop, or an Alpine Loop starting at $773.97 (about $25 off).\nRead our full Apple Watch Ultra 3 review.\nApple Watch Ultra 2 deals\nApple Watch Ultra 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799 $599 at Best Buy (with Trail Loop)\n $799 $599 at Best Buy (with Alpine Loop)\n $799 $599 at Best Buy (with Ocean Band)\n\nIf the latest Ultra isn’t what you’re after, you can save some money by opting for an Apple Watch Ultra 2, which isn’t vastly different than Apple’s latest top-of-the-line model. The wearable runs on the older S9 SiP and features Apple’s second-gen ultra wideband chip, but that may not matter to you since it still offers precise GPS tracking, a range of diving-friendly sensors, and long-lasting battery life.\nRight now, you can pick up the Apple Watch Ultra 2 at Best Buy with an Alpine Loop, a Trail Loop, or an Ocean Band starting at $599 ($200 off), which is $50 shy of its lowest price to date.\nRead our Apple Watch Ultra 2 review.",
