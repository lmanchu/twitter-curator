  "aiReason": "Technical reverse engineering piece about game preservation, niche but demonstrates infrastructure value. Not directly aligned with Lman's core expertise but has some commentary potential about software longevity and technical debt.",
  "suggestedAngle": "Connect game preservation to broader themes of infrastructure value, digital archiving challenges, and why reverse engineering skills matter for maintaining critical tech systems.",
  "draftTweet": "Impressive decompiling work on Crimsonland shows why technical infrastructure matters. Legacy code isn't just 'old tech' - it's digital heritage that requires serious engineering to preserve. Most startups won't think about this until it's too late.",
