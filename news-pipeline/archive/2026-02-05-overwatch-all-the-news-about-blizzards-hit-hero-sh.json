  "summary": "Overwatch 2, the sequel to Activision Blizzard’s hit hero shooter Overwatch, was announced in 2019 but didn’t arrive for another three years, eventually bringing a shift to five-on-five matches in PvP and a few new characters, including Overwatch’s first Black female hero. \nAfter canceling planned PvE content and unlocking its hero pool, the game’s developers eventually brought back a lot of things, like 6v6 gameplay, loot boxes, and, in 2026, its name.

Lman could analyze this as a case study for entrepreneurs on agile development, responding to user feedback, and brand resilience in a competitive market. However, it's a peripheral topic to Lman's core expertise (AI/LLM, Web3, Privacy, Startup ecosystem) and preferred content themes (Asia tech, funding, infrastructure), making it a marginal candidate.",
