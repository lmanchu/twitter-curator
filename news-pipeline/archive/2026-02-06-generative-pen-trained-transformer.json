  "aiReason": "Generative pen-trained transformer project is technically interesting and relevant to Lman's AI expertise, but we already have significant AI content. It lacks clear business angle or Asian tech connection that would make it more compelling.",
  "suggestedAngle": "Focus on the technical innovation of pen-based training methods and speculate on potential business applications in creative industries or education tech.",
  "draftTweet": "Pen-trained transformers are pushing generative AI beyond text/images into tactile domains. The real question: can handwriting recognition become the next frontier for human-AI interaction models?",
