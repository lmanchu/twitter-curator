It’s currently one of our favorite smartwatches (not to mention our favorite Fitbit smartwatch, too), offering Gemini AI support along with a wide range of health and fitness features, including dual-frequency GPS and retroactive AI activity recognition. The wearable was also named the most repairable smartwatch by iFixit, and improves on its predecessor with longer battery life, and a side-mounted charger that lets the watch double as an at-a-glance display.
