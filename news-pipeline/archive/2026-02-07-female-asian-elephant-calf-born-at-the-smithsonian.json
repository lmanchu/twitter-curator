  "aiReason": "This content about an elephant birth is entirely irrelevant to Lman's core expertise in AI/LLM, Web3, startup ecosystem, and privacy tech. It offers no clear connection to technology trends, business value, or the Asia tech scene, making it completely off-topic for Lman's audience and content strategy. Commentary and engagement potential are virtually nonexistent for Lman's specific focus.",
  "suggestedAngle": "The only possible angle would be a meta-commentary on content curation and the increasing dilution of 'tech news' on platforms like Hacker News, rather than discussing the elephant itself. This would critique content relevance and focus in the broader tech ecosystem.",
  "draftTweet": "A baby elephant was born. It's cute, but it has nothing to do with technology, startups, or business. If this is making the front page on tech sites, then our content filters are broken. Focus matters.",
