Both the AirPods Max and AirPods 4 (with and without ANC) now consistently receive discounts, as do the newer AirPods Pro 3. And while recent shopping events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday delivered some of the steepest discounts we’ve seen, there are still good deals to be found on every model in January.\nBelow, we’ve rounded up the best deals currently available on each set of AirPods, including both iterations of the AirPods 4, the third-gen AirPods Pro, and the AirPods Max. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best AirPods 4 deals\nApple AirPods 4\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129 $99 at Amazon\n $129.99 $99.99 at Walmart\n $129.99 $99.99 at Best Buy\n\n\nAirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $179 $139.99 at Amazon\n $179 $139.99 at Walmart\n $179.99 $139.99 at Best Buy\n\nAt the end of 2024, Apple introduced the AirPods 4, a pair of wireless earbuds available in two variations: a $129 standard model and a $179 noise-canceling model. Both versions represent significant upgrades over the third-gen AirPods, with a more comfortable design and improved audio performance. They’re also better for taking calls thanks to Apple’s Voice Isolation feature, which focuses the mics on your voice so you can be heard more clearly in noisy environments.\nThe $179 AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation offer a surprisingly effective noise-canceling mode, a helpful transparency mode, and several other Pro-level features. The latest AirPods Pro do a better job of tuning out noise, but the AirPods 4 with ANC still do a good job of reducing sound. They also feature other perks formerly reserved for Apple’s top-of-the-line earbuds, including wireless charging and a case with a built-in speaker that allows you to easily track it down via Apple’s Find My app.\nGiven they’ve been out for over a year, we consistently see discounts for both iterations of the AirPods 4. During Black Friday, we saw the standard model drop to a new low of $74. But right now, they’re $99 ($30 off) at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy. The AirPods 4 with ANC are $139.99 at Amazon,  Walmart, and Best Buy for $139.99, which is well above their all-time low of $99.\nRead our full AirPods 4 review.\nThe best AirPods Pro 3 deals\nAirPods Pro 3\nThe third-gen AirPods Pro add a new built-in heart rate sensor and live translation feature. They also improve upon their predecessor with enhanced noise cancellation, improved sound quality, and a fifth swappable ear tip.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 $229.99 at Amazon\n $279 $229.99 at Walmart\n\nAt its “Awe Dropping” event in September, Apple introduced the AirPods Pro 3. In addition to improved ANC and sound, the third-gen earbuds include a built-in heart rate sensor that syncs with the iPhone Fitness app, allowing you to track your pulse and calories burned across more than 50 workout types. They’re also more comfortable and secure than their predecessor, thanks to a redesigned, angled fit and five ear tip sizes — including a new XXS option. Additionally, they carry a more robust IP57 rating and support Apple’s new live translation feature, which, in our testing, generally conveys the gist well but still can’t beat a human interpreter.\nGiven how recently they launched, we’ve been surprised by how frequently the AirPods Pro 3 have been discounted. Recently, we saw the AirPods Pro 3 drop to as low as $199, which was less than their Black Friday and Cyber Monday price. As of this update, they’re available for $229.99 (about $19 off) at Amazon and Walmart.\nRead our full AirPods Pro 3 review.\nThe best AirPods Max deals\nApple AirPods Max\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $549 $449.99 at Amazon (USB-C)\n $549 $449.99 at Walmart (USB-C)\n $549 $499.99 at Best Buy (USB-C)\n\nThe AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and expansive, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response and features. They’re not the best noise-canceling headphones for most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a better pair of Bluetooth headphones if you’re an iPhone user.\nToward the end of 2024, Apple replaced the first-gen Max with a new model that features support for USB-C charging and a few new color options. In the past, we’ve seen them drop to as low as $399, but right now they’re only on sale at Amazon and Walmart for $449.99 ($100 off), which is still one of their better prices to date.\nRead our original AirPods Max review.\nUpdate, February 6th: Adjusted pricing and availability.",
