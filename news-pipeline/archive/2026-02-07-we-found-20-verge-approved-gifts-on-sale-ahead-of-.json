Several Verge-approved gadgets are seeing some of their best discounts since the holidays, with options we think will appeal to a wide range of interests, from thoughtful picks like digital photo frames to e-readers, smart speakers, smartwatches, massagers, and even practical stuff like vacuums. While some are bigger-ticket items, quite a few cost under $100, so there’s something here for a range of budgets, too.\nBelow, we’ve rounded up the best Valentine’s Day gift deals you can shop right now across a range of categories and prices, whether you’re buying for a partner, a friend, or yourself.\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2\nThe latest Powerbeats Pro are a no-brainer for athletes. They pack fantastic sound and thumping bass, along with active noise cancellation, IPX4 water resistance, and heart rate monitoring. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 $199.95 at Walmart\n $249 $199.95 at Amazon\n $249 $199.99 at Best Buy\n\nThe Amazon Echo Dot Max is on sale for $79.99 ($20 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, which matches its best price. In her review, my colleague Jennifer Pattison Tuohy called it “Amazon’s best all-around smart speaker,” improving on the fourth-gen Echo with a new elegant look that features a flat face wrapped in 3D knit fabric. It also includes an LED light ring and touch controls on the front, along with a two-way speaker system that delivers richer bass. Plus, it works with more smart home devices thanks to support for Matter, Thread, and Zigbee. It includes the upgraded Alexa Plus voice assistant, which can handle more complex requests. Read our review.\nSpeaking of Alexa-enabled gadgets, Amazon’s fourth-gen Echo Show 8 is down to $149.99 ($30 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, marking a new low. The smart display can show photos, play music, set reminders, and control compatible smart home devices without a separate hub, thanks to Zigbee, Matter, and Thread support. It also adds Alexa Plus, a faster chip, and new sensors, so it handles more complex tasks than its predecessor, though bear in mind it doesn’t always do so reliably. Read our hands-on impressions.\nGoogle TV Streamer (4K)\nGoogle’s terrific TV Streamer (4K) is the company’s best attempt at a streaming device yet, with built-in ethernet, an excellent interface, and smart home compatibility with both Matter and Thread. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99.99 $79.99 at Amazon\n $99.99 $79.99 at Google\n $99.99 $79.99 at Best Buy\n\nThe Lego Roses will last far longer than a real bouquet, and they’re probably cheaper, too. They’re now available for $9.99 ($5 off) at Amazon and Target, about $3 more than their best price to date. The 120-piece kit lets you build two red roses with adjustable stems and green leaves, so you can arrange them in a vase or pair them with other Lego botanical sets. \nThe Kobo Libra Colour is $209.99 ($20 off) at Rakuten Kobo and Target, which is $10 shy of its best price to date. It’s a great e-reader if you’re not embedded in Amazon’s ecosystem, offering a similar 7-inch color display to the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition while adding physical page-turn buttons, stylus support, and wider support for more file formats.  Read our review.\nThe Theragun Mini 3 is on sale for $179.99 ($40 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, one of its better prices to date. Although it weighs about a pound, the three-speed massage gun is powerful and includes three interchangeable attachments to target different muscle groups. The latest model is also quieter and smaller than its predecessor, so it’s even easier to travel with. You can connect it to Therabody’s app for personalized recovery plans and treatment guidance.\nSonos Era 100\nSonos’ Era 100 smart speaker is a replacement for the older Sonos One, utilizing two tweeters (left and right) and one larger woofer. In addition to Wi-Fi, the Era 100 also supports Bluetooth audio and line-in playback via an optional 3.5mm to USB-C adapter.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $219 $179 at Amazon\n $219 $179 at Sonos\n $219 $179.99 at Best Buy\n\nThe Sonos Arc Ultra is on sale for $899 ($200 off) from Sonos, Amazon, and Best Buy. Designed for larger spaces, it delivers powerful, room-filling sound thanks to its upward-firing Dolby Atmos drivers, which create a more immersive experience with audio that feels like it’s coming from above. It also improves on its predecessor with added conveniences such as Bluetooth and Trueplay tuning, making it a great option if you need better home theater audio. Read our review.\nIf you’re shopping for something cheaper, the Sonos Beam is also on sale for $369 ($130 off) directly from Sonos, at Amazon, and from Best Buy, which is just $20 shy of its all-time low. It’s a good fit for apartments or smaller living rooms, offering Dolby Atmos support with virtual height channels that create a fuller sound than Sonos’ entry-level Ray, though it doesn’t produce the same overhead effect as the Arc Ultra. Like the Arc Ultra, it boasts HDMI eARC and doubles as a smart speaker, so you can stream music and control smart home devices with Amazon Alexa.\nAmazfit Active 2\nThe Amazfit Active 2 delivers outsized value for the price. It looks spiffy and has a wide array of health tracking features, plus built-in GPS and AI chatbots to provide extra context to your data.

The smartwatch stands out for its great health and fitness tracking features, which include dual-frequency GPS and retroactive AI-powered activity recognition. It also offers Gemini support, along with handy features like raise-to-talk and a side-mounted charger that turns the watch into a small, at-a-glance display. iFixit also named it the most repairable smartwatch, in case you ever break it.

The Saros 10 combines 22,000Pa of suction with a vibrating mop and did an excellent job in our testing, picking up everything from Cheerios to pet hair. It can also lift itself by 10mm to cross taller room thresholds and retract its LiDAR tower to slide under low furniture.\nHoto’s rechargeable AutoCare Air Duster & Vacuum is on sale for $59.99 ($40 off) at Amazon, which is its lowest price to date. The handheld vacuum offers three adjustable suction levels (8,000Pa / 15,000Pa / 20,000Pa) along with five interchangeable attachment heads you can swap out depending on whether you’re cleaning hard-to-reach areas in your car or digging dirt out of a keyboard.\niPad Mini (2024)\nThe seventh-gen iPad Mini comes with Apple’s A17 Pro chip and support for Apple Intelligence.

It offers no opportunity for Lman to provide critical analysis, connect to business value, or engage his audience on relevant topics. While timely for consumers, it's irrelevant to Lman's brand.",
  "suggestedAngle": "Given the complete irrelevance, if forced to post, Lman could use this as a meta-commentary. The angle would be to contrast the superficiality of consumer holiday sales with the deep, impactful innovation Lman focuses on, reinforcing his brand's commitment to foundational tech and business value over commoditized gadgets.",
