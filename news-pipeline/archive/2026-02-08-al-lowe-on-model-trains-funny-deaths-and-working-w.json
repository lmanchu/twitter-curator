  "aiReason": "Content about a retro game developer's career, model trains, and Disney is outside Lman's core expertise in AI/LLM, Web3, startup ecosystem, and privacy tech. It offers limited opportunity for unique commentary or connection to Lman's business-focused insights.",
  "suggestedAngle": "Not suitable for Lman's feed; lacks direct relevance to his established expertise and audience interests, and does not align with preferred content categories.",
  "draftTweet": "I've been in game development for years. The topic here sounds interesting, but it doesn't really cover the deep AI, Web3, or startup ecosystem stuff that my readers want to know about. I stick to covering technology that actually creates real business results.",
