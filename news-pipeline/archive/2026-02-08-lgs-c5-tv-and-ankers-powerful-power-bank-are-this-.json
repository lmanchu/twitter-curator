  "summary": "It’s the first weekend of February, which can only mean one thing: The Super Bowl (or “Benito Bowl,” if you’re mainly tuning in for the Bad Bunny-led halftime show) is upon us. The game is Sunday, February 8th, at 6:30PM ET on Peacock, NFL Plus, and on live services that include NBC. With that out of the way, I’m here to surface this week’s best deals. There were plenty of good ones, from cheap yet extremely handy two-headed USB-C cables and a $20 sci-fi first-person shooter PC game bundle to steep discounts on big OLED TVs that will impress people at your Super Bowl watch party.\nIf you happen to be in the market for a 65-inch OLED 4K TV (can I come over?), the LG C5 is almost half off its original asking price of $2,699. Whether you buy one through Amazon for $1,397 or from Best Buy at $1399.99, there’s a good chance that you can have it installed by kickoff on Sunday. Amazon currently has fast shipping for this TV, and many Best Buy brick-and-mortar locations are likely to have this model in stock.\nLG’s C-series TVs are some of the most popular OLED models each year. With pixel-level brightness control, they boast excellent black levels and color accuracy, and are an incredible value for movie lovers, gamers, sports fans, and everyone in between. However, if you’re looking for the best of the best when it comes to brightness, Samsung’s pricier S95F beats the C5. And, while LG’s glossy screen looks fantastic, it’ll show more reflections than the S95F’s matte finish.\nLG C5 OLED TV\nLG’s midrange C5 TV is an excellent way to get OLED performance without paying top dollar. It has a good amount of brightness, excellent color accuracy out of the box, and great gaming features including 4K @ 144Hz.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2699.99 $1396.99 at Amazon (65-inch)\n $2699.99 $1399.99 at Best Buy (65-inch)\n\nIt’s been a while since we featured a good deal on Anker’s Laptop Power Bank, its 25,000mAh / 90Wh powerhouse that peaks at 100W when charging a single device (or up to 165W with two USB-C devices). Now, we’re featuring its best-ever price that’s currently happening at Newegg and through Anker itself. You can buy the black model at its all-time low price of $89.99 ($45 off) directly from Anker with code VergeYWP0QJDE.\nThis power bank’s output speed, capacity, and selection of four ports (three USB-C, one USB-A) are good and all, but it’s the small details that make this one stand out. Notably, it comes with two built-in USB-C cables, one of which retracts while the other doubles as handle.\nAnker Laptop Power Bank\nAnker’s 25,000mAh power bank sports two built-in USB-C cables (one of which is retractable), plus one USB-C and USB-A port. It tops out at 165W when charging two devices simultaneously, or 130W when charging three or four.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $119.99 $89.99 at Anker (black, with code VergeYWP0QJDE)\n\nFor those who own an iPhone 12 or newer, or a Google Pixel 10, Belkin’s Stage Powergrip is exactly the accessory you may not have realized you wanted. It’s a 9,300mAh battery-equipped gadget that adds a camera grip to your phone, snapping on snugly with MagSafe or Pixelsnap magnets, depending on the device you have. It lets you snap photos with its dedicated shutter button, and the grip can swivel to let you get the types of shots you want without feeling like you’re endangering your precious phone. There’s been a deal happening all week on the black model, which costs $68.39 at Amazon (originally $79.99, the current cost of the blue and sand-colored options).\nBelkin Stage PowerGrip\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $79.99 $68.39 at Amazon\n\nMore ways to save this weekend\nIf you have a gaming PC, or a handheld gaming PC like a Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally, I highly recommend buying a $20 game bundle currently available at Humble. The “Sci-Fi Shooters 2.0” bundle of Steam PC games includes Black Mesa (the fan-made, Valve-approved Half-Life remake), Doom Eternal, Prey Deluxe Edition, and a few other great titles. They’re all fun in their own ways, and none require a cutting-edge machine to run well. Some proceeds for your purchase will go to nonprofit organizations, including One Tree Planted and Cool Effect.\nI have one of Anker’s two-in-one USB-C cables in my home. Being able to charge two devices through one cable is very convenient, even if you aren’t constantly battling your partner for a turn at the charger. Most of us likely have more than one USB-C device we want to charge at any given time, and this cable lets you do just that. You can get the 6-foot braided cable at Amazon for $15.99, down from its original $19.99 price. The cable tops out at 140W passthrough for a single device, allowing for sufficient power to quickly charge a laptop, assuming your wall adapter is powerful enough.\nThe last-gen AirTag Bluetooth tracker dropped to its lowest price yet. Granted, it’s not a huge price drop, but compared to their original $29, $17 a pop —their current price at Amazon and Walmart — is pretty good. AirTags are the best Bluetooth trackers for iPhone users. They provide accurate tracking through the Find My app, no matter what you attach them to. Many people stick them in luggage to be able to find bags more easily after a flight, but you can put them in any tote or container that you fear losing.",
