  "suggestedAngle": "Use the 'AirTags are superior to iPads' claim as an attention-grabbing hook. Pivot to a critical discussion about the underlying technology of ubiquitous tracking devices, their privacy implications, and the delicate balance between convenience and data control.

What are the actual privacy risks of always-on tracking? The struggle between convenience and control has been going on for years.",
